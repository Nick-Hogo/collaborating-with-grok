**Claude Code Agent Skill** — Programming fact-checker for API deprecation, version changes, and community pitfalls.

[简体中文](../README.md) | English

---

## Overview

In programming assistance, the most critical problems are often not about "slow coding", but:
- API has been deprecated
- Version behavior has changed
- Community has discovered pitfalls that the model doesn't know

**collaborating-with-grok** is positioned as a **fact-checking layer**, NOT a code generator:

| Responsibility | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| ✅ Check official docs | Version numbers, API status, migration guides |
| ✅ Check GitHub issues/PRs/releases | Known bugs, breaking changes |
| ✅ Check StackOverflow/community | Common problems, solutions |
| ❌ Generate code | Code is generated by Claude; Grok only provides facts |

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Zero Dependencies** | No Python scripts required, pure SKILL.md implementation |
| **MCP Integration** | Directly calls grok-search MCP server |
| **Auto-Trigger** | Claude automatically determines when to invoke |
| **Source Attribution** | All information must include source and date |

---

## Trigger Conditions

### MUST Trigger

| Category | Keywords / Signals | Platform Focus |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Version/API** | "latest version", "is supported", "recommended way", "deprecated", "breaking change", "migration" | GitHub |
| **Errors** | Specific error messages, unexpected runtime behavior, platform-specific bugs (OS/GPU/Cloud) | StackOverflow, GitHub |
| **Tech Comparison** | "A vs B", "should I use", "community opinion", "production ready" | Reddit, GitHub |

### SKIP Trigger

- Pure algorithm problems (sorting, graph traversal, etc.)
- Well-documented stable APIs with no ambiguity
- Local refactoring with no external dependencies
- Internal DSL / proprietary protocols

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code** (v2.0.56+)
2. **grok-search MCP server** configured

### grok-search MCP Configuration

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grok-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic-ai/grok-search"],
      "env": {
        "GROK_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "GROK_API_URL": "https://api.x.ai/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Via Main Repository

Using [GudaStudio/skills](https://github.com/GuDaStudio/skills) repository:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
./install.sh --user --skill collaborating-with-grok

# Windows
.\install.ps1 -User -Skill collaborating-with-grok
```

### Option 2: Standalone Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/GuDaStudio/collaborating-with-grok.git

# Copy to Claude Code skills directory
# User-level (all projects)
cp -r collaborating-with-grok ~/.claude/skills/

# Project-level (current project only)
cp -r collaborating-with-grok ./.claude/skills/
```

---

## Usage Examples

Once installed, Claude will **automatically** trigger in appropriate scenarios. No explicit invocation needed.

### Example 1: API Deprecation Check

```
User: "Is React useEffect cleanup deprecated?"
Claude: [Auto-calls mcp__grok-search__web_search]
        [Returns Fact Check Report]
```

### Example 2: Error Lookup

```
User: "Getting TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
Claude: [Auto-calls mcp__grok-search__web_search]
        [Returns known solutions]
```

### Example 3: Tech Comparison

```
User: "Zustand vs Jotai for a 2025 project?"
Claude: [Auto-calls mcp__grok-search__web_search (platform: Reddit)]
        [Returns community comparison]
```

---

## Output Format

Claude presents findings as a structured report:

```markdown
## Fact Check: {topic}

### Status
- **Current Version**: x.x.x
- **API Status**: Active | Deprecated | Removed
- **Official Docs**: [link]

### Known Issues
- Issue #xxx: {description} [link]

### Community Practice
- Recommended: {pattern}
- Avoid: {anti-pattern}

### Sources
- [Title](url) (date)
```

## Workflow

```
Programming Request
       │
       ▼
  Trigger Check ──No──> Direct Coding
       │
      Yes
       ▼
  Grok-Search
       │
       ▼
  Fact-Check Report
       │
       ▼
  Code with Verified Facts
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Call Grok-Search for every question | Only when trigger conditions match |
| Ask Grok-Search to generate code | Only retrieve facts; Claude generates code |
| Treat as "another LLM" | Treat as fact-checking layer |
| Skip source timestamps | Always note information date |

---

## Comparison with Other Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Requires Scripts | MCP Integration |
|-------|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| `collaborating-with-codex` | Delegate coding to OpenAI Codex CLI | ✅ Python | ❌ External CLI |
| `collaborating-with-gemini` | Delegate coding to Google Gemini CLI | ✅ Python | ❌ External CLI |
| `collaborating-with-grok` | Programming fact-check (API/version/community) | ❌ None | ✅ Direct MCP |

**Key Advantage:** Pure SKILL.md implementation, no external dependencies, faster loading, simpler maintenance.

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Being Invoked

1. **Check Installation:**
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/skills/collaborating-with-grok/SKILL.md
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code** to reload Skills

3. **Test Explicitly:**
   ```
   User: "Use Grok to search for [query]"
   ```

### MCP Server Issues

1. **Verify Configuration:**
   Ask Claude: "Check Grok search configuration status"
   Claude will call `get_config_info` and report

2. **Check API Key:**
   Ensure `GROK_API_KEY` is set in `~/.claude/settings.json`
